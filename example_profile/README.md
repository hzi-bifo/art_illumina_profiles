# Example Profiles

The profiles in this folder were generated using the [ART Illumina profiling pipeline](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/art_illumina_profiles).
We used the HiSeq dataset of NA12878 from [Genome in a Bottle](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) and the ART Illumia profiling script.

The data for the bam and the bai file was downloaded using ftp:

[ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/NIST_NA12878_HG001_HiSeq_300x/RMNISTHS_30xdownsample.bam](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/NIST_NA12878_HG001_HiSeq_300x/RMNISTHS_30xdownsample.bam)
[ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/NIST_NA12878_HG001_HiSeq_300x/RMNISTHS_30xdownsample.bam.bai](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/NIST_NA12878_HG001_HiSeq_300x/RMNISTHS_30xdownsample.bam.bai)

These are also the links that are commented out in the `config.yaml` of this pipeline.
